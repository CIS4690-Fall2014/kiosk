##kiosk

###Introduction and Purpose
This project was done by CIS 4690 at the University of Central Missouri, Fall 2014. The purpose of this application is to provide information mainly about business professors (and other individuals) that are housed in the Dockery Building and Ward Edwards 1600. Students will be able to access this application on a touch screen monitor in the Dockery Building, and other [user groups](https://github.com/CIS4690-Fall2014/kiosk-documentation/blob/master/user-groups.md) will be able to edit all of the information presented on the application. The application will solve the problem of students that are seeking information like study hours, course information, etc.
