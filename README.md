#kiosk

##Introduction and Purpose
This project was done by CIS 4690 at the University of Central Missouri, Fall 2014. The purpose of this application is to provide information mainly about business professors (and other individuals) that are housed in the Dockery Building and Ward Edwards 1600. Students will be able to access this application on a touch screen monitor in the Dockery Building, and other [user groups](https://github.com/CIS4690-Fall2014/kiosk/blob/master/documentation/user-groups.md) will be able to edit all of the information presented on the application. The application will solve the problem of students that are seeking information like study hours, course information, etc.

##Documentation
All other documentation (which will be much more specific) will be available on the [documentation](https://github.com/CIS4690-Fall2014/kiosk/tree/master/documentation) folder in this project, or directly embedded into the code in this project.

###YouTube Videos
Additionally, we have created tutorial videos that will help users see exactly how to accomplish specific tasks. These are broken down by user groups, and are labeled by the specific task.
